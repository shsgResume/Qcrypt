    "RSA uses prime integer multiplication ($p, q$) to generate the encryption and decryption keys, $e, d$ of which only the encryption key $e$ are public. The ease for an intruder to listen to a message depends on the ease to obtain the other decryption integer, with the knowledge of $n=pq$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need to do prime integer factorization to decompose $n$ into two primes $p, q$, which we can check with the computation of the public encryption key $e$ to see if it is the one used in the encryption. If it is true, then computing $d$ goes with $d\\equiv e^{-1} (mod \\; \\lambda(n))$, where $\\lambda(n)$ is a totient function.\n",

    "For small prime numbers, such as $p=3, \\; q=5$. the unique solution of the factorization is easily obtained. But when the digits $p,q$ are very large, it can take thousands of years for current computers to crack the RSA encryption."
